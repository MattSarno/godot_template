# Godot Template

A template project for Godot.

## Entry Point

This template starts with a `Main` scene which acts as the entry point for the game. This scene contains a `GUI` scene where all your UI can be added.

## GUI

This is the main scene for all game UI. It is added to `Main` by default and can be expanded upon.

## Start Menu

This is the first scene loaded into `GUI`. It contains buttons to exit the game or continue. `Continue` is wired up to load the `Sandbox` scene by default.

## Sandbox

This is an "empty" scene that is purely used as the transition from the start menu. Feel free to update this scene or make a new one that the start menu can navigate to.
